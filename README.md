# DynamicPlaylistMaker
In 2020, I built a web app that creates a customized playlist based on your personal songs leveraging the Spotify API and an online machine learning algorithm. I used React for the frontend, Python + Flask for backend, OAuth 2.0 + JWTs to handle auth, Docker to run local builds and hosted the entire thing on AWS ECS. I work full stack so for this project I wanted to test my skills in building an entire web app from scratch. It took over +80 hours, I enjoyed the entire process from whiteboarding to coding to publicizing and got my fair share of eclectic music from it :) The site is down now but feel free to check out the repo.
